# Medicine-tracker-webiste
Many people, especially elderly individuals and those with chronic conditions, often forget to take their medications on time or struggle to keep track of available medicines. This leads to missed doses, delayed treatments, or last-minute panic when medicines run out. There's a need for a simple website that helps users track medicine availability.
